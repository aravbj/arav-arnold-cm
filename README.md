# Solutions to Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics by V.I.Arnold 

## Status
**Under Construction**


## Description
I am working on studying Arnold's Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics thoroughly to get a solid base in advanced topics in the field as well as for a primer in differential geometry. I made this document containing my attempts at solutions of every problem in the book for my own personal use but if anyone else is interested feel free to use it. I will be uploading more as and when time permits.

**Disclaimer: This is a solo effort and I am not a mathematician**. For any corrections or suggestions (which I'm sure there are plenty of), please contact me at the email in the document. 

Thanks for visiting :)
